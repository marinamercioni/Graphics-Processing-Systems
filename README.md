# Graphics-Processing-Systems 
The purpose of this study is to implement Discrete Cosine Transform on an image transformation, developing a graphic interface. <br />
Python was used as programing language. <br />

## Data <br />
Couple of iamges available in Data directory. <br />

## Code <br />
Available in DiscreteCosineTransform.py script. <br />

## Graphic Interface <br />
Available in dist diretory as an .exe file. <br />

## Setup <br />
Creating an virtual environment <br />
python3 -m venv your_env_name <br />

## Installing libraries 
Needed: tkinter, pillow, scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib, scipy and pyinstaller for generating .exe file. <br />
pip install tk <br />
pip install pillow <br />
pip install -U scikit-learn <br />
pip install numpy <br />
pip install matplotlib <br />
pip install scipy <br />
pip install pyinstaller <br />

To obtain .exe file <br />
Run command: 
pyinstaller --onefile DiscreteCosineTransform.py
