# Graphics-Processing-Systems
The purpose of this study is to implement Discrete Cosine Transform on an image transformation, developing a graphic interface.
Python was used as programing language. 

Data
Couple of iamges available in Data directory.

Code
Available in DiscreteCosineTransform.py script.

Graphic Interface
Available in dist diretory as an .exe file.

Setup
Creating an virtual environment
python3 -m venv your_env_name

Installing libraries needed: tkinter, pillow, scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib, scipy and pyinstaller for generating .exe file.
pip install tk
pip install pillow
pip install -U scikit-learn
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install scipy
pip install pyinstaller
